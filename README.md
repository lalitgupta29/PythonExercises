# PythonExercises
Easy to difficult Python exercises with solutions

This repository contains python practice exercise and solutions. The excercises are taked from the website http://www.practicepython.org/
The solutions are just my way of working out the problem. There may be other and possibly better ways to do it. 

The solutions will be updated in Jupyter Notebook along with the problem statement as I work through them.
